                LOCK YOUR ANDROID SCREEN ORIENTATION TO ANY ANGLE YOU NEED: FROM PORTRAIT_0 TO LANDSCAPE_270.</p>

            <p>You are watching a YouTube video and moving your hands around, the screen keeps rotating and the video also annoyingly rotates between portrait and landscape modes. The default Quick Settings tile cannot help you? SCREEN ROTATION LOCK is here to solve your problem. Just get the app, rotate your screen to any angles your device supports, then hit the floating button, and finally, go back to where you left or just open the app you need. No more rotation mess at all.</p>

            <p>Need to reduce the wait time? QUICK MODE is there. Enable it, then add the app icon to Home screen. Everytime you tap it, your screen orientation will immediately be locked in landscape mode (90 degree). So you can open YouTube or any browser and watch full screen videos right away. No rotation interruption.</p>

            <p>On Nougat? There's a QS tile for you. So you can perform the lock action within any apps just like you have been able to do with the default QS tile, with one big difference: Not just portrait but also any modes.</p>

            <p>The app is completely free. Both free of charge and free of advertisement. And now, it's even open source. The code can be found here: <a style="color: #d35400" href="https://github.com/YuhApps/ScreenRotationLock">https://github.com/YuhApps/ScreenRotationLock</a>.
