            <p>Your device has become slow because your text messages and call log are full but you still need them for sometime later? Or are you a ROM flashaholic that changes ROM so frequently? BACKUP is just your solution. With just a few simple finger taps, you can easily back up and restore your text messages, call logs and other data. Just hit the action and the app will take care of the rest. No worries of data loss! How simple it is.</p>

            <p>What makes YUH APPS' BACKUP different from other similar apps?</p>

            <p>► <span style="color: #34495e; font-family:  'Roboto'; font-weight: bold">Secure database:</span> Unlike other apps, databases generated by BACKUP is not human-readable, so other people have no idea about your data at all even if they have found your data.</p>
