            <p>Your device has become slow because your text messages and call log are full but you still need them for sometime later? Or are you a ROM flashaholic that changes ROM so frequently?

            <p>► <span style="color: #34495e; font-family: RobotoBold">Less advertisement banners:</span> Although the app is ad-supported, ad banners are placed to prevent users from mis-tapping.</p>

            <p>► <span style="color: #34495e; font-family: RobotoBold">Secure database:</span> Unlike other apps, databases generated by BACKUP is not human-readable, so other people have no idea about your data at all even if they have found your data.</p>
