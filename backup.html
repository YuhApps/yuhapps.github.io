                BACK UP AND RESTORE MESSAGES, CALL LOGS, APPLICATIONS, AND MORE, ON ANDROID DEVICES.</p>

            <p>Your device has become slow because your text messages and call log are full but you still need them for sometime later? Or are you a ROM flashaholic that changes ROM so frequently? BACKUP is just your solution. With just a few simple finger taps, you can easily back up and restore your text messages, call logs and other data. Just hit the action and the app will take care of the rest. No worries of data loss! How simple it is.</p>

            <p>What makes YUH APPS' BACKUP different from other similar apps?</p>

            <p>► <span class="highlight">Simplicity:</span> BACKUP is so easy to use. It takes only a few taps to perform back up and restore messages, call logs, applications and wifi passwords as well as bluetooth data.</p>

            <p>► <span class="highlight">Less advertisement banners:</span> Although the app is ad-supported, ad banners are placed to prevent users from mis-tapping.</p>

            <p>► <span class="highlight">Secure database:</span> Unlike other apps, databases generated by BACKUP is not human-readable, so other people have no idea about your data at all even if they have found your data.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="highlight">PRO FEATURES:</p>
            <p>► Ad removal, </p>
            <p>► Faster backup and restore progresses,</p>
            <p>► Back up and restore Wifi passwords and data of Bluetooth paired devices,</p>
            <p>► Some features on Android 7.1 onwards, such as app shortcuts.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="highlight">(*) Message and Call log back up and restore don't work on Wifi-only tablets (without cellular).</p>
